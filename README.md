Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet

Project Goals
In this project, I build my own reference cheat sheet by applying my knowledge that I
learned in HTML and CSS.

To complete this project, I should have completed the codecademy Introduction to HTML course 
through the HTML tables lesson, and lesson in Learn CSS: Selectors and Visual Rules.
